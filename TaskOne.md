### 1. Functional Tests:

- Verify that the endpoint returns the correct country information when queried with valid country names.
- Check the response format, such as ensuring it returns a JSON object with the expected fields like country name, capital, population, etc.
- Test with various valid country names to ensure all supported countries return accurate data.
- Check if the endpoint handles country names with special characters or spaces correctly.

### 2. Boundary Tests:

- Test the behavior of the endpoint with boundary inputs such as very long country names, which may exceed common input lengths.
- Verify how the endpoint behaves with the minimum and maximum allowed lengths of country names.

### 3. Negative Tests:

- Test the endpoint with invalid country names or non-existing country names and ensure it returns appropriate error messages or error status codes (e.g., 404 Not Found).
- Check how the endpoint handles incorrect or malformed requests, such as missing parameters.

### 4.Concurrency Tests:

- Simulate concurrent requests to the endpoint and check for any race conditions or thread safety issues.
- Verify that the endpoint remains responsive and performs well under concurrent load.

### 5. Performance Tests:

- Test the endpoint's response time and latency by sending a high number of requests in a short period.
- Measure and analyze the response times to ensure they are within acceptable limits.

### 6. Localization Tests:

- Test the endpoint with country names in different languages or character encodings to ensure it handles multilingual inputs correctly.

### 7. Edge Case Tests:

- Test the endpoint with extreme edge cases, such as empty inputs or inputs with only special characters, and ensure it behaves as expected.

### 8. Load Testing:

- Conduct load testing to evaluate the endpoint's performance and stability under heavy load conditions.
